## Summary

1.  In the assessment file, it is noted to use JavaScript. I am not sure whether this is a suggestion or a requirement, so I have used TypeScript, as I prefer working with it. If you were expecting the solution to be written in JavaScript, please let me know, and I will rewrite it accordingly.

2.  There was no validation requirement in the assessment, but I thought some kind of validation would be nice, so I have used Formik. Field values are saved in Formik, but since you specifically asked to save field data in the state, I have created a separate state for it.

3.  It is stated to use "dark mode for styles." I was not completely sure what you meant by that, so I assumed you wanted to have a dark theme.
